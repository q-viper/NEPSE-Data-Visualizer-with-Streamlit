    "# Visualizing Nepal Stock Exchange Data Using Streamlit on Heroku\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "If you are from Nepal then you already know what Nepal Stock Exchange means. Honestly I don't know how to describe stock market but after watching movie [Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_(film)), I wanted to take a look at NEPSE data by myself. I am not sure about how old data are present on the NEPSE but I think there are data available from 1980. I started to scrap data on 2019 January and it was very difficult task for me to write the right codes. But there are great and kind programmers who shares their great skills on GitHub. So I came across this [repository](https://github.com/rojesh-shikhrakar/NepseCrawler). I started to scrap all the data of past transaction and it was quite frustrating after server hanged up so I found the best way of scrapping is by scrapping data by each year and then write it on CSV file. Please follow [this mine repository](https://github.com/q-viper/NEPSE-Data-Analysis) for more scrapping code but note that **We don't use any of those data so just look that repository for more information only (if available).**  And rest is on this blog.\n",

    "[Here is a demo Heroku app that we will be building](https://nepse-data-visualizer.herokuapp.com/).\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where was I lost?\n",
    "From nearly a month, I had not written any blogs because we had our huge festival in Nepal, Dashain and Tihar. Also I was playing lots of games like Injustice Gods Among Us. And I have also been busy watching series like Silicon Valley and Mr. Robot. And good news about me must be I have joined [NAAMI](https://www.naamii.com.np) as Junior Unity Software Developer from last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspiration\n",
    "2020 is not a great year for anyone because of the pandemic and students like me are suffering from hard anxiety of their career and I am one of them. But I have met some awesome people on the web whose work always keeps me inspiring to write more. And I have noticed that [Jithendra's blogs](https://jithendrabsy.me/data-sabbath/about/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jithendrabsy/) posts are very insightful for learning Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contribution\n",
    "If you are looking right into this blog please try to contribute to Agriculture field by finding a model to classify and detect [corn leaf infection](https://www.kaggle.com/qramkrishna/corn-leaf-infection-dataset). I have worked hard to prepare dataset and made it live on kaggle. Also if you are interested in my more awesome work then [Contour Based Writing System](https://q-viper.github.io/2020/08/28/gesture-based-visually-writing-system-web-app/) must be your first choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Systems Ready\n",
    "Of course we need python along with few other libraries. If you are wondering what should be the requirements then please follow the [repository and download](https://github.com/q-viper/NEPSE-Data-Visualizer-with-Streamlit/) all the codes then TADAAAAA!!!! But to describe it on steps, please follow below steps:\n",
